;PROBLEM A:

;Design a data definition to help travellers plan their next trip. 
;A trip should specify an origin, destination, mode of transport and 
;duration (in days).

(define-struct trip (origin destination transport duration))

;; Trip is (make-trip String String String Integer)
;; interp. a trip with origin, destination, mode of transport, and duration in days.

;PROBLEM B:
;
;You have just found out that you have to use all your days off work 
;on your next vacation before they expire at the end of the year. 
;Comparing two options for a trip, you want to take the one that 
;lasts the longest. Design a function that compares two trips and 
;returns the trip with the longest duration.
;
;Note that the rule for templating a function that consumes two 
;compound data parameters is for the template to include all 
;the selectors for both parameters.

;; Trip Trip -> Trip
;; Given two trips, produce the trip with the longest duration
